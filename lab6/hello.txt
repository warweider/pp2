The cactus is a unique plant adapted to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth, especially deserts. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to endure long periods without rain. Instead of leaves, most cacti have spines, which help reduce water loss and protect the plant from animals.
Cacti come in many shapes and sizesâ€”from tiny round ones that fit in your hand to tall giants like the saguaro that can grow over 10 meters high. They produce bright, beautiful flowers that often bloom for a short time, usually at night, to attract pollinators such as bats and moths.
Besides their beauty, cacti play an important ecological role and symbolize endurance, protection, and strength.
